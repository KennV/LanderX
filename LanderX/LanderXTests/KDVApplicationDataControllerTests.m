/**
Ok here are some proposed tests
- a different PSK as a _lazy init
- a thorough breakdown of the init-chain
- Object-Class
 - object sub-entities
 - KDVApplicationDataController
 - setting the subEntity from here?
 - testing all values in the SubEntities
- Possibly Controller Protocol?
 - might not be needed in this class but used in
 - SomeVueController <ApplicationDataProtocol>
- Load / Save / Delete
- currentEntity()
