 OKAY One of the first things to do is to effect the surgical seperation of the persistantStateContainer from the AppDeli; In many ways this is more important than the structure of the data that We will be modelling.
_moreover this is where test begins_
 
 
### Unfortunately I have done too much tonight to rely on favorable conditions ###
therefore before I add tests cases to the state as it is *AND* also introduce new classes into the data model why don't I stop here and reflect on the architecture
And also do a git commit
